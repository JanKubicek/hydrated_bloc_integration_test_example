# hydrated_bloc_integration_test_example

Hydrated bloc within integration test does not work.

There are two integration tests in app_test.dart which are basically the same, the only differenve is how the app is initialized (I've been using second method in my current projects)

You can run the tests:
1. flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
2. flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_driver.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart

I've been using the second method in my current projects
